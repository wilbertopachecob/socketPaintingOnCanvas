## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd socketPaintingOnCanvas
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. In a separate terminal, start the client development server:
```bash
npm run dev:client
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3001` (React development server)
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:3000` (Express server)

## Available Scripts

### Production
- `npm start` - Start the production server (serves built React app)
- `npm run build` - Build both client and server for production
- `npm run build:client` - Build React app for production
- `npm run build:server` - Prepare server for production

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start the backend development server with nodemon
- `npm run dev:client` - Start the React development server with hot reload

### Testing

- `user_count_update` - Update of current user count
- `error` - Error messages

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Server** (`src/server.js`): Express server setup with middleware and error handling
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`): Organized API endpoints with modular routing
- **Socket Handler** (`src/socket/socketHandler.js`): Manages Socket.IO connections and events
- **Drawing Manager** (`src/socket/drawingManager.js`): Handles drawing state and validation

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript using modern patterns:

- **App Component** (`client/App.tsx`): Main React application component
- **Canvas Component** (`client/components/Canvas.tsx`): Canvas rendering component
- **Controls Component** (`client/components/Controls.tsx`): Control panel with drawing tools
- **ErrorMessage Component** (`client/components/ErrorMessage.tsx`): Error display component
- **useSocket Hook** (`client/hooks/useSocket.ts`): Custom hook for Socket.IO connection management
- **useCanvas Hook** (`client/hooks/useCanvas.ts`): Custom hook for canvas drawing logic and event handling
- **Type Definitions** (`client/types/index.ts`): TypeScript interfaces and types

### Key Features

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
2. **Component Architecture**: Modular React components for maintainability and reusability
3. **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for socket connections and canvas management
4. **Input Validation**: All drawing data is validated on both client and server
5. **Memory Management**: Drawing history is limited to prevent memory issues
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
7. **Mobile Support**: Touch events for mobile devices with responsive controls
8. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes with collapsible controls
9. **Real-time Updates**: Instant synchronization between users
10. **Build Optimization**: Webpack-based build system with code splitting and optimization

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests:

- **React Component Tests**: Test React components using Testing Library
- **Custom Hook Tests**: Test React hooks in isolation
- **Backend Unit Tests**: Test individual server components
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and server functionality
- **TypeScript**: Type checking prevents many runtime errors
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reports available for both frontend and backend

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
